This repository including three notebooks:
  exploratory data analysis, 
  preprocessing modelling and model tuning, 
  prediction from model. 
You could find them in notebook directory


in main folder, there is an api made by fast api, and I was about to make a dockerfile and run it in a container in gcp.
However it was not part of challenge, but I liked to make an api and use it during presentation. The api works.
